Digital frequency meter

Input pins:
-external clock (probably 50MHz crystal);
-signal to be measured;

Output pins:
-control for the 7-segment displays;

Outline:
From the external clock, two internal clocks are generated: a 1Hz clock, and a reference clock (variable frequency, scales the measurement). The measurements are performed every second, when the counter is enabled for the time between two ref_clock pulses. If the counter overflows, the reference clock frequency is decreased by a factor of 10. If the most significant digit is 0, the reference clock frequency is increased by a factor of 10 (with upper and lower boundaries, of course).
